# Note: Labels are currently commented out as a precaution.
# The workflow .github/workflows/setup-labels.yml automatically creates these labels.
# Once the workflow runs and labels are created, these can be uncommented:
#   - "dependencies" - for all dependency updates
#   - "automated" - for automated PRs
#   - "github-actions" - for GitHub Actions updates
# See .github/LABELS.md for more information.
