# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# Note: If you want to use custom labels, create them in GitHub first:
#   - "dependencies" - for all dependency updates
#   - "automated" - for automated PRs
#   - "github-actions" - for GitHub Actions updates
# For now, labels are commented out to avoid errors with missing labels
